        <p>I feel I am like a <strong>submarine</strong>. I may not show everything outside, but inside I am always thinking, learning, and improving.</p>
        <p>Like a submarine moves deep under water, I also go deep into my thoughts. I try to <em>understand everything quietly</em> before saying anything.</p>
        <p>Submarines work in <abbr title="Extremely High Pressure">EHP</abbr> areas. In the same way, I also stay calm and do my best even under pressure.</p>
        <p>Knowledge is like the ocean—very big and full of new things. I learn from <cite>books, people, and daily experiences</cite>.</p>
        <p>Just like the sea has different levels, I also have different moods and strengths. I do what is needed at the right time.</p>
        <p>I enjoy science also. Water is written as H<sub>2</sub>O, and energy is E = mc<sup>2</sup>. These things inspire me a lot.</p>
